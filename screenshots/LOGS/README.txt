I was able to resolve the HPA issue  but the Frontend application cannot make HTTP Request to the Backend hence the no screenshoot for Activity at the backend  I am yet to resolve this issue.

In the Trouble shooting section we are asked to set the URL Variable but the parameter i modified was just the ApiHost value in the frontend application which i set to the aws url for the publicreverseproxy service.

attached are images of the front end error.

Please I need help resolving this issue thanks.
